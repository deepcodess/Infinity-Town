## ✨ Key Features
- Customizable **Blender 3D assets** integrated into the scene.
- **Infinite city effect** through object recycling and movement logic.
- **Dynamic weather system** with clouds, thunderstorms & rainfall.
- **Directional lighting** that simulates realistic evening lighting.
- **Realtime shadow mapping** for buildings, streets and moving elements.
- **Reflective puddles** on the roads for added realism.
- Extended **render/view distance** for large-scale visibility.
- Optimized for stable performance in real-time rendering.
